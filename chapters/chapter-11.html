        <p>The official opening marks the culmination of the development effort. A smooth handover from the project team to the operations team is essential for long-term success.</p>

            <li><strong>Ramp-Up Period:</strong> The initial months of operation where occupancy gradually increases to stabilized levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Operational Handover</h2>
