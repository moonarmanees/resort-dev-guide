        <h1>Chapter 5: Design and Engineering Development</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>The design phase translates the approved concept into detailed architectural and engineering plans. This phase is iterative and requires close collaboration between the architect, engineers, and project manager.</p>
        
        <h2>Design Stages</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Conceptual Design:</strong> Initial sketches and massing studies to establish the overall layout and aesthetic.</li>
            <li><strong>Schematic Design:</strong> Development of floor plans, elevations, and sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Development:</strong> Refinement of the design with detailed specifications for materials, finishes, and systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction Documents:</strong> Final, detailed drawings and specifications used for bidding and construction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Key Engineering Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structural Design:</strong> Ensuring all structures can withstand local weather conditions, including wind and wave loads.</li>
            <li><strong>MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing):</strong> Design of power generation (often diesel generators with solar integration), desalination plants for fresh water, wastewater treatment systems, and HVAC.</li>
            <li><strong>Coastal Engineering:</strong> Design of jetties, breakwaters, and other marine structures to minimize environmental impact.</li>
        </ul>
