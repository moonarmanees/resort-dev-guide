    <main>
        <p>The construction phase involves the physical realization of the resort. It requires careful planning, logistics, and management, especially given the remote island locations.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Construction Stages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobilization:</strong> The contractor transports equipment, materials, and labor to the island. Temporary facilities (labor camps, storage) are set up.</li>
            <li><strong>Site Preparation:</strong> Clearing vegetation (as per EIA), setting out building locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation and Structural Works:</strong> Construction of foundations, columns, beams, and slabs for all buildings.</li>
            <li><strong>MEP First Fix:</strong> Installation of concealed plumbing, electrical conduits, and ductwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Finishing Works:</strong> Plastering, tiling, painting, and installation of doors, windows, and fixtures.</li>
            <li><strong>Exterior and Landscaping:</strong> Construction of pools, decks, pathways, and planting of vegetation.</li>
        </ul>
