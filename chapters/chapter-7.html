        <h1>Chapter 7: Contractor Procurement and Management</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Selecting the right contractor is critical to ensuring the quality, cost, and schedule of the construction phase. A transparent and competitive procurement process is highly recommended.</p>
        
        <h2>Procurement Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prequalification:</strong> Interested contractors are vetted based on their experience, financial stability, and technical capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Tendering (Bidding):</strong> Prequalified contractors are invited to submit bids based on the detailed construction documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Bid Evaluation:</strong> Bids are evaluated based on price, proposed schedule, methodology, and compliance with the tender requirements. (See Appendix F for a template).</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiation and Award:</strong> The preferred contractor is selected, and contract terms are finalized. A Letter of Award (LOA) is issued.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Contract Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lump Sum (Fixed Price):</strong> The contractor agrees to complete the project for a predetermined price. Best for projects with a clearly defined scope.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Plus:</strong> The owner pays the contractor for the actual costs of labor and materials, plus an agreed-upon fee for profit and overhead. More flexible but carries more financial risk for the owner.</li>
            <li><strong>Design-Build:</strong> A single contract is awarded for both the design and construction of the project.</li>
        </ul>
