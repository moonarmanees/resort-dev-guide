        <h1>Chapter 6: Project Financing Strategies</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Securing adequate financing is one of the most significant hurdles in resort development. A robust financial plan and a compelling investment proposal are essential.</p>
        
        <h2>Common Financing Sources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equity Financing:</strong> Funds provided by the owners or private investors in exchange for an ownership stake.</li>
            <li><strong>Debt Financing:</strong> Loans from commercial banks or development finance institutions (DFIs). This often requires a significant equity contribution and a detailed project plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Mezzanine Financing:</strong> A hybrid of debt and equity financing that is subordinate to senior debt.</li>
            <li><strong>Presales of Villas:</strong> Selling long-term leases on private villas within the resort to generate upfront capital.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Investment Proposal</h2>
        <p>A comprehensive investment package should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A detailed Executive Summary.</li>
            <li>The full Feasibility Study (from Chapter 4).</li>
            <li>Concept and Schematic Designs.</li>
            <li>Projected construction budget and timeline.</li>
            <li>Biographies of the key project team members.</li>
            <li>A clear exit strategy for investors.</li>
        </ul>
